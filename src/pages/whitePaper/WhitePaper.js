      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        Additionally, the ecosystem incorporates generative AI, supporting
        businesses in efficient communication and transaction processing. Nu's
        architecture not only redefines the financial landscape but also fosters
        a dynamic social community, making it an all-in-one super dApp for the
        future of social interaction and finance.{" "}
      </p>
      <h3 className={style.h3}>Here is how the Nu Ecosystem works</h3>
      <p>
        The Nu ecosystem operates as a cohesive and innovative platform,
        leveraging blockchain technology to promote social interaction, and
        streamline financial operations through social and business management
        portals. It seamlessly connects peer-to-peer engagement, users with
        digital assets, banking, and payments, allowing them to send and receive
        transactions in their preferred native currencies.
      </p>
      <br/>

      <p>
        Users are encouraged to actively engage with articles, process
        transactions, and participate in communities, earning rewards for their
        contributions. Nu also serves as a bridge, providing businesses and
        enterprises with open API solutions to facilitate a cost-effective
        business hub for innovation, communication, book keeping and digital
        transactions.{" "}
      </p>
      <br/>

      <p>
        The nu social ecosystem leverages both the Polygon Matic network and
        stellar Soroban network as the foundation to process multiple digital
        assets. While Stellar Soroban Network is the backbone of the Nu
        consortium for payment transactions, the nu native digital assets, NRU
        is on the Polygon network for social and payment rewards. NRU serves as
        a rewards token for user engagement and can be Swapped for Stellar’s
        native digital assets on the Stellar (XLM / USDC) Network. nu’s social
        network seamlessly integrates with the Polygon Matic network through its
        zkEVM (Zero Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine), enabling community
        members to utilize multiple EVM currencies within the nu ecosystem
        without the hassle of switching between multiple currency wallets. The
        EVM network has more than 20,000 L1 - L2 currencies, with more than 400
        that are notable. The nu Blockchain consortium will host the most
        promising EVM currencies, alongside with Stellar Soroban Network
        currencies. This facilitates smooth processing of on-chain and off-chain
        transactions in multiple currencies.
      </p>
      <br/>

      <p>
        At the heart of the nu ecosystem is the Stellar Network, all external
        payments within the nu-nuPayment network must outside of the Stellar
        Network must swap to the Stellar network to process external payments
        such as, withdrawals, online and instore purchases between nu and
        nuPayments. All users are required to convert their assets to Stellar
        Network.{" "}
      </p>
      <br/>

      <p>
        As an example, when a nu social user wants to process external payments
        to shop online, in store or withdraw funds, users must Swap non Stellar
        Network “XLM” currencies using our bridged Dex to the Stellar Network -
        USDC.{" "}
      </p>
      <br/>

      <p>
        nuPayments, is our invoice management portal, that accepts payments from
        nu social users, facilitating transactions in the Stellar protocol.
        Individuals and businesses using nu (social) nuPayments (Business
        Portal) have direct access to businesses within the nuPayments
        ecosystem. This enables seamless payment for zero knowledge capabilities
        for Web2 and Web3 users. nuPayments also extends its functionality to
        non-nu (Social) users, allowing transactions in various currencies for
        Individuals nuPayment users. However, for external purchases,
        withdrawals and purchases internally, users must Swap their digital
        assets to the Stellar Network (XLM / USDC). Through a strategic
        partnership with our merchant services, our POS infrastructure enables
        businesses and users to process transactions effortlessly, bridging the
        gap between Web2 and Web 3 capabilities for everyday users.

        a cost-effective solution.{" "}
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        Nu leverages blockchain technology to provide transparency and security,
        addressing concerns about data privacy. It aims to streamline
        inefficient cross-border transactions, making them faster and more
        accessible. Furthermore, Nu encourages user engagement and participation
        through a reward system, fostering a vibrant user community. The
        platform unifies fragmented financial and social apps, making it more
        convenient for users and businesses to communicate and transact.{" "}
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        In essence, Nu endeavors to transform outdated financial systems into a
        modern, inclusive, and efficient financial ecosystem that benefits
        social users, businesses, and underserved communities.
      </p>
      <h3 className={style.h3}>Nu’s Protocol</h3>
      <p>
        The Nu Social Protocol operates within the dynamic space of the
        blockchain ecosystem, orchestrated by a network of nodes engaging in
        real-time interactions to process a myriad of activities—ranging from
        content creation and social engagement to seamless communication. Nu is
        a Pioneer of a trussless multi-decentralized ecosystem, by allowing
        users to effortlessly participate in a borderless social stream, earn
        NRU rewards and assert control over their data, privacy, and overall
        user experience. Unlike traditional platforms imposing constraints, Nu’s
        open environment employs keyword tracking to safeguard against malicious
        intent from peers or potential global threats. The Nu community wields
        authority over the social algorithm, underpinned by blockchain tools
        that champion freedom for every Nu user.
      </p>
      <br/>

      <p>
        The utility of Nu extends to the transactions transpiring within its
        ecosystem, leveraging distributed transactions on the blockchain to
        process digital assets in harmony with well-defined smart contracts on
        and off chain. This protocol is the driving force behind efficient,
        fewer, and faster transactions, ensuring a seamless experience devoid of
        unnecessary constraints. In essence, Nu's innovative approach is laying
        the groundwork for a truly groundbreaking and liberating social and
        financial ecosystem.
      </p>
      <h3 className={style.h3}>NRU - Nu’s native currency</h3>
      <p>
        NRU, Nu's native currency, stands as the cornerstone of the ecosystem,
        offering users a micro transactional reward system. Users are
        incentivized for active social engagement, enabling peer-to-peer
        payments, and opting for the seamless swapping of NRU with all network
        currencies within the Nu ecosystem. The NRU digital asset, residing
        within the Polygon network, provides users with a competitive edge,
        featuring a 1.3% transaction fee for NRU transactions, while any
        currencies outside of NRU incur a 1.7% transaction fee. Notably, the
        versatility of NRU extends beyond the Polygon network, as it can be
        effortlessly bridged with multiple currencies, unlocking a plethora of
        swap solutions for users and businesses within the Nu ecosystem.
      </p>
      <h3 className={style.h3}>Security + Compliance</h3>
      <p>
        Security is a primary focus concern in the Nu ecosystem, where a secure
        framework is in place to safeguard our community and businesses in
        synergies. We adhere to regulatory guidelines, ensuring compliance with
        payment services regulations to create a secure environment for all
        users. Our social platform incorporates encryption protocols, ensuring
        the confidentiality and integrity of user data as a decentralized
        network. Moreover, our commitment to regulatory compliance is embedded
        in our operations, aligning with industry standards to provide a secure
        and trusted space for social engagement and financial transactions. This
        approach not only fortifies our ecosystem against potential threats but
        also provides a trustworthy and compliant environment for the Nu
        community and businesses alike.
      </p>
